## About me
My background is in mathematical biology. This background has grown
into experience using dynamical system models that solve applied problems in epidemiology,
an appreciation for the beauty in mathematics,
and a growing interest in machine learning. 
Currently, I use machine learning in R and Python to forecast the risk of animal-borne 
infectious diseases. Before that, I worked on models of animal
vaccination, with an emphasis on understanding the
benefits of transmissible vaccines. See below for details on current and recent projects.

## Using machine learning to predict pathogenic threats

The 2020 Covid-19 pandemic is a salient reminder that approximately 40% of new human diseases stem from viruses or bacteria that circulate in wildlife populations. Covid-19 is believed to be transmitted by bats. Other examples are HIV from chimpanzees and Influenza A from birds. Many emerging human diseases originate in low and middle income regions of the world with limited health system infrastructure. Consequently, humanity is largely unaware of new emergent infectious diseases until after many humans are impacted (i.e., after a pandemic). 

As part of the DARPA-funded PREEMPT (PREventing the EMergence of Pathogenic Threats) project, I worked with a team of researchers at the University of Idaho to build a machine learning framework that predicts the risk of pathogen transmission from a wildlife reservoir into human populations. We applied our framework to Lassa virus, an RNA arenavirus that primarily circulates in rodent populations of West Africa and causes Lassa Fever when transmitted to humans. Rough estimates indicate that the Lassa virus infects around 100,000 - 300,000 per year, and as many as 13 million individuals per year. The true number is difficult to estimate because, while 2\% of cases are fatal, upwards of 80\% of all cases are asymptomatic. However, the high mutational ability of RNA viruses like Lassa allows the possibility of new, more dangerous strains emerging in human populations. The GIF below shows our model's predictions of Lassa transmission to humans in West Africa.

The forecasting model consists of different candidate submodels (layers) that each forecast a different aspect of the risk of Lassa Fever. The final forecasting model consists of a set of submodels that best predict the number of human Lassa cases in Nigeria. The first layer uses boosted regression trees that, when given land cover and weather attributes of known locations of Lassa occurence, predict the probability of Lassa being present at any 5 km by 5 km pixel across West Africa. Similarly, the second layer uses boosted regression trees to forecast the probability that the rodent reservoir of Lassa, the multimammate rat \emph{Mastomys natalensis}, occurs in a pixel. Finally, the third layer uses rodent trapping data to predict seasonal migrations of rats into and out of domestic settings.  The form of the forecast is

\[ \text{Lassa transmission risk} \sim D_L(x) D_R(x) T(t,x)\],

where $D_L(x)$ is the probability of Lassa occuring at spatial position x, $D_R(x)$ gives the probability that the primary rodent reservoir occurs, and $T(t,x)$ describes the seasonal migration of the reservoir. Here, dependence on the spatial coordinate $x$ occurs through weather and land cover predictors from satellite datasets. This work is submitted to the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, and available as a [BioRxiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.979658v1). Code that is discussed in the manuscript is available in [this github repository](https://github.com/54481andrew/Vaccinate-a-fluctuating-population).

## When should you vaccinate a fluctuating population? 

<br> <br>

Wildlife vaccination has proven itself an effective means of controlling diseases that can otherwise spread to humans and domestic pets (e.g. rabies in fox, coyotes, and raccoons). Given the success of vaccination campaigns in fox and raccoon populations, it is likely that vaccination will be used on other wildlife as well (e.g., Ebola in gorillas and/or bats, Lassa in rodents). From past campaigns on raccoons and fox, we know that vaccinating in the fall generally results in greater vaccine uptake, simply because the most recent juvenile population is developed and foraging at that time. My work with an undergraduate at the University of Idaho used a mathematical model to explore how timing of vaccination can influence the outcome of a disease management program in wildlife. Our work was published in the Journal of Applied Ecology (Schreiner, Basinski, 2020), and the associated code is available in [this github repository](https://github.com/54481andrew/Vaccinate-a-fluctuating-population).
