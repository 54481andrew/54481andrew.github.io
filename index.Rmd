My work is centered on building forecasting models of animal-borne infectious disease. As a postdoc in [Scott Nuismer's lab] (https://www.leeef.org/team),I've developed a forecasting model of Lassa fever.  

I graduated from the [University of Utah] (www.math.utah.edu) with a PhD in mathematics in 2016.
